// This class contains various implementations for point-in-polyhedron
// queries.  The planes stored with the faces are used in all cases to
// reject ray-face intersection tests, a quick culling operation.
//
// The algorithm is to cast a ray from the input point P and test for
// intersection against each face of the polyhedron.  If the ray only
// intersects faces at interior points (not vertices, not edge points),
// then the point is inside when the number of intersections is odd and
// the point is outside when the number of intersections is even.  If the
// ray intersects an edge or a vertex, then the counting must be handled
// differently.  The details are tedious.  As an alternative, the approach
// here is to allow you to specify 2*N+1 rays, where N >= 0.  You should
// choose these rays randomly.  Each ray reports "inside" or "outside".
// Whichever result occurs N+1 or more times is the "winner".  The input
// rayQuantity is 2*N+1.  The input array Direction must have rayQuantity
// elements.  If you are feeling lucky, choose rayQuantity to be 1.
//
// TO DO.  Add a Contains function that uses exact arithmetic and that
// casts one ray, keeping track of the parity correctly when the ray
// intersects a vertex or an edge.  If the faces are always triangles,
// the use of barycentric coordinates gives us a "normalized" measurement
// of how close to a vertex or an edge the intersection point is.  This,
// in turn, might make it easy to use filtered predicates, which will be
// faster than always using exact arithmetic.  If the faces are not
// triangles, any triangulation introduces edges that are not face
// boundary edges.  These should be ignored by the special-case handling
// of boundary edges.  In the most general case of simple polygon faces
// without triangulation, it is not immediately clear how to compute a
// "normalized" measurement that will allow us to use filtered predicates
// in an easy manner.
